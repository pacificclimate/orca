# orca (OPeNDAP Request Compiler Application)

The purpose of orca is to pull apart large `OPeNDAP` requests to `THREDDS` into bite-sized chunks. These chunks are then reassembled before returning to the user.

## Installation
We use `make` to handle the installation process. Copy and paste this section into your terminal:
```
make
source /tmp/orca/venv/bin/activate
```
